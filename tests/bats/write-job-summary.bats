# Behaviour coverage for scripts/write-job-summary.sh — the run report rendered
# into GitHub's job summary.
#
# Nothing needs stubbing: the script's only side effect is appending Markdown to
# the file named by GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY, so a temp file makes it fully testable.
# Two properties matter more than any single line of output and are asserted
# throughout: it never exits non-zero (its caller runs `if: always()`, where a
# failure would turn a green run red or mask a red one), and a value it was not
# given drops its row rather than rendering blank.
