# Behaviour coverage for scripts/probe-image-tag.sh — the registry probe that
# lets `mode: release` skip promoting a tag that is already published.
#
# `docker` is stubbed to log its argv and then either print a digest
# (STUB_MANIFEST) or fail with a registry error (STUB_DOCKER_ERR, exiting
# STUB_DOCKER_STATUS). The asymmetry is the whole point of the suite: exit 0
# means "resolved to this exact manifest", and *every* other outcome — absent,
# broken, unauthenticated, unset input, a reply that is not a digest — must be
# exit 1 so the caller still does the work.
#
# The probe reports a DIGEST rather than a yes/no because a tag is a mutable
# pointer that anyone with registry write access can create; only the digest
# tells the caller whether what is published is what it was about to publish.
