# Scan assembled PR images and route the results to their sinks.
#
# Called by the "Scan image and report" step in action.yml (mode: ci), once the
# pr-<N> image(s) have been built and pushed. This is Diatreme's slice of the
# Magma Moose pipeline beyond build+promote: it inspects the *assembled* image
# (base-image packages and whatever the Dockerfile added — things the source
# dependency scan never sees) and routes two artifact categories:
#
#   - CycloneDX SBOM  → Dependency-Track  (the assembled-image project; DT
#                       re-derives component CVEs from the SBOM)
#   - scan findings   → DefectDojo        (optional; OS CVEs, misconfigs, and
#                       secrets in layers — what SBOM matching misses)
#
# Reporting is visibility-first: by default the scan never fails the PR. A scan
# that cannot run at all is a different thing — a broken scanner is a *tool
# error* (build red), never reported as "0 findings". The optional SCAN_GATE
# turns net findings into a blocking check (a blunt severity threshold for now;
# net-new diffing against the base image is the intended direction).
#
# Required env:
#   IMAGE_REFS - newline-separated, fully-qualified image refs to scan, e.g.
#                ghcr.io/owner/app:pr-12. Produced by the action from the bake
#                targets that were just pushed.
#
# Optional env (scan):
#   SCAN_SEVERITY - Trivy --severity filter for findings. Default CRITICAL,HIGH.
#   SCANNERS      - Trivy --scanners. Default vuln,secret,misconfig.
#   SCAN_GATE     - true | false. Fail (exit 1) when net findings exist at/above
#                   SCAN_SEVERITY. Default false (non-blocking, visibility only).
#
# Optional env (Dependency-Track sink — skipped unless URL is set):
#   DEPENDENCY_TRACK_URL, DEPENDENCY_TRACK_API_KEY
#   DEPENDENCY_TRACK_PROJECT_NAME    - overrides the per-image default (the
#                                      image repository path).
#   DEPENDENCY_TRACK_PROJECT_VERSION - overrides the per-image default (the
#                                      image tag, e.g. pr-12).
#
# Optional env (DefectDojo sink — skipped unless URL is set):
#   DEFECTDOJO_URL, DEFECTDOJO_API_KEY
#   DEFECTDOJO_ENGAGEMENT       - numeric engagement id, OR
#   DEFECTDOJO_PRODUCT_NAME     - with auto_create_context (engagement created)
#   DEFECTDOJO_ENGAGEMENT_NAME  - engagement name for the auto-create path.
#
# Side effects:
#   - Writes `scanned=true|false` and `image-findings=<count>` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - scanned (sinks are failure-isolated; finding counts don't block unless
#       SCAN_GATE=true)
#   1 - a scanner/tool error (build red), or SCAN_GATE=true with net findings
