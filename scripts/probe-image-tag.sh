# Ask the registry whether an image tag already exists, so `mode: release` can
# skip promote work that is provably already done.
#
# Why this exists: re-running a release whose images were already published
# repeats the whole promote — and, whenever the provenance check on the pr-<N>
# source image no longer passes, a full fresh build on top of it. Neither
# produces anything the registry does not already hold. A multi-target promote
# that died half way is the sharper case: the re-run redoes every target that
# already landed before it reaches the one that did not, so the longer the
# matrix the more of the re-run is waste.
#
# The probe is deliberately one-sided. Only a positive, successful answer — the
# manifest came back — may skip work. Absence, a registry outage, an expired
# credential and an unparseable reply all mean "do the work". Skipping on an
# unproven answer would leave the release tag pointing at the previous
# release's code with nothing in the log to say so, which is far worse than an
# unnecessary retag.
#
# Reads the manifest instead of pulling: `imagetools inspect` is a registry API
# call that transfers no layers, and it answers for a manifest list (multi-arch)
# exactly as it does for a single image — `docker pull` would do neither.
#
# It reports the manifest DIGEST rather than a bare yes/no, because a tag is a
# mutable pointer and anyone holding `packages: write` on the registry can make
# one exist. "A tag with this name exists" is therefore not a reason to skip
# anything; only "this tag already points at the exact manifest we were about to
# point it at" is, and that comparison needs digests. The caller does the
# comparing — see the skip gate in `action.yml`'s promote step.
#
# Required env:
#   IMAGE_REF   - fully-qualified ref to probe, e.g. ghcr.io/acme/app:v1.2.3.
#
# Optional env:
#   DIGEST_FILE  - path to write the resolved manifest digest to on success.
#                  Written only on exit 0, and always a complete `sha256:…`.
#   VERDICT_FILE - path to write one word to: `present`, `absent` or `unknown`.
#                  The exit code folds the last two together on purpose: the
#                  skip gate must treat "not there" and "would not say" alike.
#                  The `promote-from` preflight must not. There a missing
#                  source image stops the promotion before anything is tagged,
#                  while a registry that would not answer is left for the
#                  retag to settle. That caller reads the difference here.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - the tag resolves to a manifest, whose digest is in DIGEST_FILE.
#   1 - absent, indeterminate, or IMAGE_REF unset; the caller must do the work.
#       Anything that is not a plain "not found" also emits `::warning::`, so an
#       operator who wonders why the gate never fires can see the reason.
