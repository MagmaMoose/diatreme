# Upload a CycloneDX SBOM to a Dependency-Track server.
#
# Called by scripts/scan-image.sh (the "Scan image and report" step in
# action.yml, mode: ci) once per assembled image. Dependency-Track is the
# SBOM/component sink for the Magma Moose pipeline: it ingests the CycloneDX
# BOM and re-derives component CVEs itself, so a plain component inventory is
# enough — we never push "findings" here (that is DefectDojo's job).
#
# This is the *assembled-image* SBOM project, deliberately distinct from the
# *source-dependency* SBOM that Chargate pushes for the same repo. They are two
# projects on one server: the source SBOM only sees declared dependencies, the
# image SBOM also sees base-image packages and anything the Dockerfile added.
#
# Wire format mirrors Chargate's known-working client: POST /api/v1/bom
# multipart/form-data with the BOM as a raw file part (no base64 — friendlier to
# reverse proxies), a leading UTF-8 BOM marker stripped, and an identifying
# User-Agent so edge WAFs don't ban the default "curl/X.Y" signature.
#
# Failure-isolated by default (rule: any reporting backend can be down without
# failing the PR gate). A DT outage logs a ::warning:: and exits 0; set
# STRICT=true to make upload failure fatal.
#
# Required env:
#   DEPENDENCY_TRACK_URL      - DT base URL, e.g. https://dtrack.example.com
#                               (no trailing /api). Empty → skip silently.
#   DEPENDENCY_TRACK_API_KEY  - DT API key with BOM_UPLOAD (+ PROJECT_CREATION_UPLOAD
#                               when AUTO_CREATE is true).
#   BOM_FILE                  - path to the CycloneDX JSON to upload.
#   PROJECT_NAME              - DT project name (the assembled-image project).
#   PROJECT_VERSION           - DT project version (e.g. the pr-<N> tag).
#
# Optional env:
#   AUTO_CREATE   - true | false. Create the project on first upload. Default true.
#   DT_USER_AGENT - override the request User-Agent.
#   STRICT        - true | false. Treat an upload error as fatal. Default false.
#
# Side effects:
#   - Masks DEPENDENCY_TRACK_API_KEY in the workflow log.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - uploaded, skipped (no URL), or upload failed while not STRICT
#   1 - misconfiguration, or upload failed while STRICT=true

# Dependency-Track rejects a CycloneDX spec it does not recognise outright:

#   HTTP 400 {"title":"The uploaded BOM is invalid","detail":"Unrecognized specVersion 1.7"}
#
# Trivy emits the newest spec its build knows and has NO flag to choose one, so a
# routine Trivy bump silently outruns the server: 4.14.2 accepts up to 1.6, Trivy
# 0.71 already writes 1.7. Every released image failed this way while the DefectDojo
# half of the same scan imported fine, which is what made it look like a
# Dependency-Track fault rather than a spec mismatch. The sink is failure-isolated,
# so nothing went red — the projects were simply created empty and stayed that way.
#
# Relabel to the ceiling rather than pinning Trivy: a security scanner must stay
# current, and its CycloneDX output has so far been backward-compatible in
# substance (verified end to end against 4.14.2 — a relabelled Trivy BOM ingests
# its components normally). Nothing is dropped or rewritten but the version claim;
# if a future spec genuinely is incompatible the server rejects it exactly as it
# does today, which is no worse than the status quo.
#
# Raise DT_MAX_CYCLONEDX_SPEC when the server learns a newer spec, and delete this
# block once the floor supports whatever Trivy emits.
