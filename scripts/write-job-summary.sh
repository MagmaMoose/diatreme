# Render what the run resolved into the GitHub job summary.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A release run decides a great deal on the consumer's behalf
# — which environment the branch maps to, which versioning backend answered,
# what version and tag came out of it, whether the image was promoted or
# rebuilt, what the scanner counted — and until now it wrote every one of those
# answers to the step log and nowhere else. The log is hundreds of lines spread
# over ~40 steps, most of which are skipped, so "what did this release actually
# ship?" is a question every consumer answers by scrolling. The job summary is
# the one surface GitHub renders at the top of the run page; that is where the
# answer belongs.
#
# This is a reporter, not a gate. It decides nothing, writes no outputs, and
# cannot fail. Its caller runs `if: always()`, so a failed run still shows what
# it managed to resolve before it died — which is exactly when the summary
# earns its keep. Two rules follow from that:
#
#   1. Every value is optional. A run that died before `Detect environment` has
#      no environment, no version and no tag; each missing value drops its row
#      instead of rendering an empty one, so the summary never implies that
#      something was resolved to nothing.
#   2. It always exits 0. Turning a green run red — or worse, masking a red one
#      — in order to report on it would be an absurd trade.
#
# The shape (heading, `·`-separated headline, `| Metric | Value |` table of
# populated rows, one status line) is deliberately the same shape the other
# tools in this pipeline emit, so a run page that carries several of them reads
# as one report rather than three dialects.
#
# Env — all optional; an absent value drops its row:
#   MODE                    ci | release | enable-auto-merge.
#   VERSION, TAG            released version and its git tag.
#   ENVIRONMENT             resolved target environment.
#   IS_PRERELEASE           "true"/"false".
#   RELEASED                "true"/"false". EMPTY is NOT "false": it means the
#                           run never reached normalisation, and is reported as
#                           an incomplete run rather than as "nothing to do".
#   VERSIONING_TOOL         backend that produced the version.
#   PROMOTED_FROM           prerelease tag a `promote-from` run released as
#                           stable. No backend produced that version, so this
#                           row stands where "Versioning tool" otherwise would.
#   REGISTRY, OWNER,        parts of the image reference; whichever are
#   IMAGE_NAME              supplied are joined into one pullable ref.
#   PR_NUMBER               PR the run is about (ci, enable-auto-merge).
#   CI_IMAGE_TAG            the tag a ci build pushed (pr-<N>, or
#                           <branch>-<sha7>-<time> off a pull request). Wins
#                           over VERSION and PR_NUMBER: it is the tag that was
#                           actually pushed, not one rebuilt from inputs.
#   IMAGES_PROMOTED,        promote tallies. The row appears whenever the
#   IMAGES_SKIPPED,         promote ran, zeros included — "0 rebuilt" is the
#   IMAGES_REBUILT          reassuring half of that row.
#   VERSION_FILES_UPDATED   tracked files the version was injected into.
#   PACKAGE_PUBLISHED       "true"/"false".
#   IMAGE_SCANNED,          scan outcome. The severity filter is folded into
#   IMAGE_FINDINGS,         the row label: "3 findings" says nothing without
#   IMAGE_SCAN_SEVERITY     the band it was counted at.
#   IMAGES_SIGNED           number of released images cosign-signed.
#   AUTO_MERGE_METHOD       merge method enabled (enable-auto-merge).
#   PROMOTE_OUTCOME         the `steps.<id>.outcome` of the image promote.
#                           RELEASED is settled when the tag is cut, which is
#                           BEFORE the image is promoted, so on its own it
#                           reports a release whose image never landed as
#                           released. A `promote-from` run can fail exactly
#                           there by design: it has no rebuild to fall back on.
#   BUILD_OUTCOME,          the `steps.<id>.outcome` of the ci image build and
#   AUTO_MERGE_OUTCOME      of the auto-merge step. Those two modes have no
#                           equivalent of RELEASED to key off, and every other
#                           value they are handed is resolved before the work
#                           happens — so without an outcome the summary would
#                           claim a push, or an enabled auto-merge, on runs
#                           where the step failed. Absent ⇒ no success claim.
#   DEPLOY_ONLY             "true" when a ci run skipped the image build
#                           because the PR changes nothing but deploy-paths.
#   GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY     file to append to. Unset/empty ⇒ silent no-op,
#                           which is also what makes this testable.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - always. See rule 2 above.
