Diatreme holds a GitHub App private key and mints short-lived, write-scoped
installation tokens for other people's repositories. This page describes how it
protects that, and what you're responsible for.

To report a vulnerability, use
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/MagmaMoose/diatreme/security/advisories/new).
Don't open a public issue. The full policy, scope and response targets are in
[`SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/MagmaMoose/diatreme/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## What stops one repository minting another's token

`/token` takes an OIDC token and a repository. It mints only for the repository
in the token's own `repository` claim: if the body asks for a different one, the
request is refused with `403 repo_mismatch`. The claim comes from GitHub, not
from the caller, so a repository cannot ask for a token it wasn't issued for.

Verification pins the issuer before selecting its key set, so a token with a
forged `iss` can't steer the broker into verifying against a different tenant's
keys. Audience is checked against an explicit list. Expiry and not-before are
enforced.

Self-hosted deployments can narrow further with
[`ALLOWED_REPOSITORIES`](reference/configuration.md#allowed_repositories).

## Token scope and lifetime

Minted tokens carry `contents: write` and `pull_requests: write` by default, and
are scoped to a single repository. They inherit GitHub's lifetime, currently one
hour. A deployment can narrow the permission set with
[`TOKEN_PERMISSIONS`](reference/configuration.md#token_permissions), but nothing
can widen a token past what the App itself was granted at install time.

The action masks the token with `::add-mask::` the moment it arrives, so it's
redacted in the run log.

## Secret handling

- The App private key, the bearer secret and the webhook secret live in the
  platform's secret store:
  - **Python/Lambda broker**: AWS SSM Parameter Store and Lambda environment.
  - **TypeScript Worker**: Cloudflare Secrets and environment (`.dev.vars` is
    gitignored; only `.dev.vars.example` with placeholders is tracked).
- The bearer on `/sign` and `/releases` is compared in constant time.
- `/webhook` verifies an HMAC-SHA256 over the raw request body before parsing
  it, so an unsigned payload is never interpreted.
- Nothing logs a token, or any slice of one. Failure logs carry claim metadata
  and the classified reason, never the credential, and every field is truncated
  so a hostile token can't flood the log.

## Attack surface kept deliberately small

The TypeScript Cloudflare Worker implementation keeps `workers_dev` and `preview_urls`
off in `wrangler.jsonc`. Either would expose a second publicly reachable hostname for
a live token minter, inheriting production secrets and bypassing the rules bound to
the custom domain. The custom domain is the only intended door. (The production Python
Lambda broker has equivalent controls at the API Gateway layer.)

Repository owner and name are validated against `A-Za-z0-9_.-` before they're
interpolated into any API URL.

## What you're responsible for

**Pin by SHA for strict supply-chain reproducibility.** `@v2` is a floating tag
this repository force-updates after every stable release, so it moves under you
by design. `uses: MagmaMoose/diatreme@<sha>` doesn't.

**Grant the job only the permissions it needs.** `id-token: write` is required
for the OIDC exchange. `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` are needed
only for the modes that use them. See [Setup](setup.md#required-permissions).

**Treat the broker hostname as part of your trust boundary.** Overriding
`token-broker-url` points your OIDC tokens at someone else's server. Those tokens
are short-lived and repository-scoped, but they are still credentials. Don't
override it unless you run the broker.

## Supported versions
