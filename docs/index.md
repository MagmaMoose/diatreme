# Diatreme

**Diatreme is a release/deployment orchestrator.** It has two independent surfaces
in one repository that communicate over HTTP, neither imports the other:

- **Composite action** (`action.yml` + `scripts/`), published to the GitHub
  Marketplace. Runs semantic versioning, GitHub Releases, Docker image build and
  promotion, image scanning with SBOM/finding routing, and promotion-PR automation.
- **Hosted broker**, the GitHub App backend at `api.diatreme.magmamoose.com`.
  An OIDC to installation-token broker and an App-attributed commit and tag
  signer. Most users never touch it directly. `worker/` in this repository is
  its TypeScript implementation; see [Deployment](operations/deployment.md) for
  what actually serves that hostname.

Install the action:

```yaml
- uses: MagmaMoose/diatreme@v2
  with:
    mode: release
```

| Surface | Path | Toolchain | Ships to |

| Broker (production) | `broker/` | Python, `pytest`, `boto3` | AWS Lambda, eu-west-1 |
| Broker (legacy) | `worker/` | TypeScript, `wrangler`, `vitest` | Rollback target (not currently serving) |
