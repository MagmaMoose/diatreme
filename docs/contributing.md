# Contributing

The authoritative contributor guide is [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/MagmaMoose/diatreme/blob/main/AGENTS.md)
at the repo root. This page is a short orientation; `AGENTS.md` has the full rules.

## Repository boundary

- Keep exactly **one** root action metadata file: `action.yml` (or `action.yaml`).
  CI fails otherwise.
- The worker is **self-contained** under `worker/`; its only runtime dependency is
  `jose`. Do not couple it to the action scripts or vendor code from the private
  `MagmaMoose/diatreme-pro` dashboard repo.

## Editing rules

- **Preserve action input names, output names, defaults, and behaviour** unless a
  breaking change is explicitly approved; every consumer pins to this contract.
- Keep `README.md` examples aligned with `action.yml`.
- Shell scripts must stay executable in Git (`git update-index --chmod=+x`).
- Never commit secrets, `.dev.vars`, build output, or caches.

## Local validation

Action surface (repo root):

```bash
ruby -e 'require "yaml"; YAML.load_file("action.yml")'
actionlint -color=false
shellcheck -S warning scripts/*.sh
bats tests/bats
```

Broker surface:

- Python broker (`broker/`):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest tests
  ```
- TypeScript Worker rollback target (`cd worker/`):
  ```bash
  npm ci && npm run check   # typecheck + vitest + wrangler dry-run
  ```

## CI gates

- `ci.yaml`: validates both surfaces (actionlint, shellcheck, bats, a
  python-semantic-release pin smoke-test; worker typecheck + tests; broker tests).
- `release.yaml`: dogfoods `uses: ./` to release the action and moves the floating
  major tag.
- `deploy-worker.yaml`: validates and deploys `worker/` to Cloudflare as the
  rollback target (not currently serving).
- `security.yml`: the org Chargate security gate.
- `docs.yml`: builds this site with `mkdocs build --strict` and publishes it to
  GitHub Pages on pushes to `main` touching `docs/**` or `mkdocs.yml`.
- `broker-smoke-aws.yml`: weekly end-to-end proof that both broker hostnames
  (served by the Python/Lambda broker) turn a real OIDC token into a working
  installation token.

Note that `docs.yml` only runs on `main`. A docs change that breaks a link
passes pull-request CI and fails after merge, so run `mkdocs build --strict`
locally before opening the PR.

## Where to put documentation

Two surfaces, kept apart on purpose:

- `./docs` is the published human site. Reference and architecture pages carry
  a `sources` HTML comment under the H1 listing the files they document, so
  staleness can be detected mechanically. Keep the nav in `mkdocs.yml` in sync
  with the pages.
- `.claude/*.md` is terse agent context, not published.

`README.md` owns the exhaustive input and output tables. Pages under `./docs`
link to it rather than copying it, so the two can't drift.
