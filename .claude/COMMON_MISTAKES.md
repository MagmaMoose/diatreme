# Common mistakes (footguns)

- **One root action file.** Exactly one `action.yml` at repo root; CI fails otherwise.
  Input/output **names, defaults and behaviour are frozen** — consumers pin by SHA, so a
  change breaks repos that cannot be updated. Keep README examples aligned.
- **Shell scripts need the exec bit in Git.** `core.fileMode=false`, so a new `scripts/*.sh`
  ships `100644` and breaks CI: `git update-index --chmod=+x scripts/<f>.sh`. `.mjs` run via
  `node` don't need it; `tests/bats/*.bats` are run *by* bats — leave those `100644`.
- **Keep the worker self-contained**: only runtime dep is `jose`. Don't couple it to
  `scripts/`, and never vendor code from the private `MagmaMoose/diatreme-pro`.
- **`bats tests/bats` fails only `action-shell-syntax` locally** on macOS system Ruby 2.6
  (`YAML.safe_load_file` missing). Not a real failure; it passes on CI.
- **`createRemoteJWKSet` does NOT self-heal a key rotation** — don't "simplify" the forced
  reload or the cooldown in `worker/`. Mechanics in `.claude/INFRA_NOTES.md`.
- **Never swallow an error with a bare `catch {}` on the /token path.** That turned a JWKS
  outage into a permanent, unfalsifiable `invalid_oidc_token` (#147). Classify on jose's
  `.code`, never `instanceof JOSEError` (all jose errors extend it). A *retrieval* fault is
  503, never 401.
- **The broker fallback must never fire on 4xx.** A rejected token is an answer, not an
  outage. Connection failure and 5xx only; `tests/bats/request-public-app-token.bats` pins it.
- **Copilot/triage/quota features were removed** and the KV binding that served them is gone.
  Don't reintroduce either.
- **Never commit** secrets, `.dev.vars`, or caches (`node_modules/`, `.wrangler/`,
  `coverage/`, `site/`, `broker/.venv/`).
- **Pinning psr is not pinning psr's dependencies.** `scripts/psr-requirements.txt`
  pins the CLI exactly, but pip resolved its transitive deps fresh on every release
  run: GitPython 3.1.60 deleted `Actor.name_email_regex`, psr 10.6.1 reads it to
  validate `commit_author`, and every consumer release broke with no Diatreme change.
  Pin the offending dep there too. Note `--version` / `--help` never load a config,
  so the CI smoke test now resolves a real version in a throwaway repo.
- After editing `scripts/`, run `shellcheck -S warning scripts/*.sh` and `actionlint`.

Broker internals, infrastructure, DNS and TLS: `.claude/INFRA_NOTES.md`.

- **The image sinks fire in `mode: release` ONLY — never wire them into the `pr-<N>` scan.**
  Dependency-Track and DefectDojo describe what is *deployed*. A pr-`<N>` upload succeeds and
  looks completely correct, which is why this is easy to get wrong: the damage is cumulative,
  not immediate. One Dependency-Track project version per pull request, for ever, and the
  "current" inventory ends up describing whichever PR happened to run last rather than what
  is actually running. Chargate learned the same lesson on its source BOM and already refuses
  to upload on pull requests. The CI scan still runs — its job is `image-scan-gate` and the
  log — but it carries no sink env at all, and `tests/bats/scan-image.bats` asserts that in
  both directions. A severity gate on the release scan is likewise pointless: the tag is cut
  and the image pushed by then, so it could only paint a finished release red.
- **Released refs are derived in THREE places now** (Promote images, cosign signing, and the
  release scan), each re-running `bake --print` and appending `:${NORMALIZE_TAG}`. They must
  stay identical or the org signs one set of images and inventories another. There is a bats
  guard counting the two derivation literals; if you add a fourth consumer, update it rather
  than deleting it.

- **Trivy emits the newest CycloneDX spec it knows, and Dependency-Track rejects any spec it
  does not.** `HTTP 400 {"detail":"Unrecognized specVersion 1.7"}` — Trivy 0.71 writes 1.7,
  DT 4.14.2 accepts up to 1.6, and Trivy has NO flag to choose a version. So a routine
  scanner bump silently outruns the server. It is the quiet kind of failure: the sink is
  failure-isolated so nothing goes red, the DefectDojo half of the SAME scan imports fine
  (HTTP 201), and `autoCreate` still leaves a project behind — so the symptom is a project
  that exists, was created today, and has never had a BOM. Every released image failed this
  way and it read as a Dependency-Track fault rather than a spec mismatch. The uploader now
  relabels down to `DT_MAX_CYCLONEDX_SPEC` (default 1.6); raise that when the server learns
  a newer spec, and never "fix" this by pinning Trivy — a security scanner has to stay
  current. Note the same trap is latent in Chargate: it ships Syft, which still emits 1.6,
  so it will break identically the day Syft moves.

- **A squash merge destroys every commit-message versioning heuristic.** "Squash and
  merge" on a `release/1.15.0` PR collapses the branch's `feat:`/`fix:` commits into one
  bullet-list body, the `^feat:` anchors stop matching, and the backend falls back to the
  trunk's default increment — `1.15.0` ships as `1.14.5`, every step green, and that
  mislabelled image is what the cluster pulls. `release-branch-versioning: auto` (default)
  reads the version out of HEAD's merge subject instead; `scripts/detect-release-branch-version.sh`
  holds the grammars. It fires only on a stable branch, only when the derived version is
  ahead of the latest released tag, and never when `version-override` or `force-bump` is
  set. Do not widen the free-text grammar to scan the commit *body*: PR descriptions live
  there and routinely name a release branch, so a body scan re-pins the release to an
  already-published version, and push-release-tag.sh then no-ops the whole release without
  a single red step.
- **GitVersion's root `increment` loses to a branch's own.** `force-bump` used to reach
  GitVersion as `overrideConfig: increment=Minor`, which sets the root key. Any GitFlow
  config pinning `branches: main: increment: Patch` (the ordinary shape) swallowed it whole
  and still cut a patch, with no diagnostic: the operator asked for a minor release and got
  `1.14.6`. force-bump now bypasses GitVersion and bumps the latest stable tag, like the
  semantic-release paths. `tests/bats/action-input-defaults.bats` pins that the override is
  gone.
